I have been reading resumés lately in a couple of different capacities, and let me
tell you all something: They suck.

### The Conventional Wisdom Makes you Look Conventional

The conventional wisdom of resumé writing has you buzz-wording up your
achievements and relating everything you've ever done in terms of _crushing
those KPIs_ and _LOOK AT ALL THE MONEY_.

This isn't bad advice, but it tends to result in a whole lot of largely
indistinguishable pablum. A resumé that performs all of the standard tricks is
like a Ford Focus - servicable, but unexciting. (Full Disclosure: I drive a Ford
Focus. It's a fine automobile, but I don't _get excited_ about driving it. Your
goal in applying for a job is get your future teammates _excited_ about working
with you.)

The kind of resumés I get to read are obviously for software developers and the
ones that get rejected fall into two basic categories.

1. All Computers I Have Known
2. I Am A Self-Directed Learner Who Likes To Solve Hard Problems

As a human, these are the ones that make my eyes glaze over and skip to the end
where I can plausibly say I've reviewed your resumé and then throw it away.
Please do not make my job hard. If you make my job hard before I've even hired
you, you have violated the One Commandment of Getting A Job:

> Convince your future teammates that you will make their life easier.

Interestingly - I find that senior resumés tend toward the first type while the
junior resumés are clustered around the second. I get that the plural of
anecdote is not data, so take that with as much salt as you need.

Let's talk about these two failure modes and what you ought to do to address
them.

### The Conventional Wisdom is Actual Wisdom Tho

But first, an aside: I kinda ran down the "conventional wisdom" back there,
which was a little unfair, because there's some good stuff in there. I'm
guessing you all know or have heard of these, since we all have Google and we've
all looked up "why does my resumé keep getting rejected?"

So quick recap:

1. _Action Words_ - make it sound like you're the star of this story, because
you are!
2. _Measurable Outcomes_ - All these graphs go up and to the right, because
that's where the future is!
3. _Please, please, please proofread_ - You probably won't get dinged for dangling
participles or whatever, but consistent misuse of words or a lot of common
grammar mistakes (they're, there, their) are Bad News.

Now onto critiquing the bad resumé you may have already written.

### To All The Computers I've Known Before

{% include image.html url="/assets/photos/willy.jpg" class="right" caption="Am I the only one who likes this song?" %}

Let's start with How To List your Skills.  This is very, very straightforward.

1. Copy them from the job ad

**That's it.  That's the whole thing.** Copy each of the technologies listed in
the job ad over to your resumé, then delete them if you're not comfortable with
them. If you know something adjacent then you can put that in *instead*. Like
you can put down "Cloud Formation" instead of "Terraform" _if you don't have
Terraform_.

Now if there's no overlap at this point, then maybe consider that this isn't the
job for you.

Let's try one on for size (modified from an actual listing):

>  * Experience with Processing.js
>  * Experience with Python, Ruby, or Node
>  * Strong knowledge in OOD, domain-driven design, and microservices
>  * Experience working in Agile Teams

Skills I might write down:

* Ruby
* Python
* NodeJS
* Software Architecture including DDD, OOD and microservices
* Agile Methodolgies including Scrum and XP

Note how I skipped Processing.js because I have never used it. With this amount
of information it's not possible to know how important Processing is to the job,
so we'll just leave that part out.

I tend to put these in a little list right under my name, so that
people can read my resumé and see the intersection between what they're looking
for and what I have right away. That way, they don't have to read several pages of
responsibilities, or things like this:

> Created custom dashboard for Elatic Monitoring for RHEL 6.4 clusters written in
  Processing.js and Graylog

I don't know what half of that means, and I have to read your resumé _really
carefully_ to come up with the answer to my question "Does this person know
Processing.JS?" - if the prime directive of job interviewing is showing how
you will make your team's life easier, start by demonstrating this by making
the reviewers job *easy*.

If you by some chance find yourself writing a bulleted list of technologies
longer than like ... 5 then _just stop_. Back up and write down the interesting
ones! I'm sure it's interesting to the right audience that you used some Java
program I've never heard of to do a task I don't understand, but this is a
Python shop and I just wanna know if you can AWS.

### You are unique, just Like every other self-directed learner who likes to solve hard problems

{% include image.html url="/assets/photos/snowflake.jpg" class="left" caption="Does it really matter that they're all unique when there are eleventy-billion of them?" %}

Next to "I'm sorry sir, but that's our policy." - this has got to be my least
favorite sentence in the English language. It's almost entirely content free
and everybody knows that you're either lying or dissembling.[<sup>1</sup>](#liar)

For the love of dog, if you have this sentence in your resumé or cover letter,
please remove it unless you know for a hard absolute fact that you are talking
to a machine. It is the platonic form of "telling not showing" in writing. Like
the sentence "Sir Gilroy the Fair is the hero of this story" - it only really
works as satire. You need to find a way to demonstrate this truth to your reader
without just baldly stating it.

Think about this: What's an engaging way of telling this story, without
resorting to asserting it free of context? Start by telling a story
about a time it was _true of you_:

> "This one time, I was supposed to make a poker game, but I didn't know anything
> about poker, so I learned all about poker, and wrote a program that I couldn't
> beat at poker."

Now, if you're a newish developer you might have to dig pretty deep on this one -
and you probably only have a limited set of really good stories to draw on.
But think about it - when was the last time you encountered a seemingly
intractable problem you needed to do some research to solve? Last week?
If you've never had to do this, then you might need to do some more
training. Being a "self-directed learner who likes to solve hard problems" is
a significant fraction of being a developer. Everybody has this.

### Tell Me A Story

People tend to approach cover letters and job applications as opportunities to
list a lot of good things about themselves, or to tell other people about
themselves. I think this is *exactly* the wrong approach. Tell me a story with
you as the hero. Make it engaging. Make it a thing that I want to read so that
at the end of your resumé I'm having a The-End-of-Return-of-the-Jedi moment.
"Yeah, that was awesome! What happens next? Let's make a sequel! And not wait 30
years!"

{% include image.html url="/assets/photos/ewok.png" class="right" caption="Me and this stick gonna mess you up" %}

Okay, RoTJ might be a bit of a stretch, and I'm not advocating for you to
include tiny, savage bears in your cover letter, but please make your job
application engaging. I read enough boring business writing everyday. I do
enough *work*. Again, the main dimension people are hired on is "is this person
going to make my life easier," and if you begin by making me read a long, boring
document then you've just demonstrated the opposite. STAHP.

All of that is easier said than done. Here are some actionable tips to
make your resumé better.

1. **Read. It. Aloud.**

    Seriously do this one. This is like the secret to good writing. Read
    it aloud, maybe even to an audience and see if it sounds engaging.  Perform your
    resumé like a one act play and make sure that you're the hero.

2. **Write the Resume You Wish You Had**

    Do not send me lies, but write down a fictionalized account of your career up to
    this point.  This shows _you_ your values.  Did you write "\* Improved
    performance of page load 1000%" or "\* Created a new process for gnarfling the
    garthok that saved the company $1000 per millisecond"?   You have revealed the
    kind of thing you'd _like_ to write down, and the sort of story you'd _like_ to
    star in.  Now go back to your "real life" and write the same sort of stories
    from your experience. "\* Decreased page size from 20M to 150K" and "\*
    Developed a Garthok Gnarfling Guide to share with other developers."

3. **Keep it short.  Tailor it to every job.**

    Every job is different.  Get good at tailoring your experience and
    accomplishments to individual companies. Do not tell me how good you are at
    sword fighting if we're going to get in a laser gun fight on Endor. This seems
    like a lot of work until you do it a few times and you find that you can remix a
    lot of the same content. A sentence here, a phrase there.  You want to tailor
    it for every company because you want to keep it under two pages. I'm busy, and
    I have reasonable expectations about how exciting a resumé can be. Think _Cat in
    the Hat_ not _War and Peace._

4. **Action! Excitement!**

    A Jedi might not crave these things, but your resumé reviewer does. If you're a
    clever person who likes to have a good time don't be afraid to let that come
    across in your resumé.  I mean, don't try too hard, but don't wordsmith your
    introduction to the point that it sounds like it was written by a lawyer. If
    you're a detail oriented perfectionist (good for you!) then make sure your
    resumé _reflects_ this - a single conservative font with perfect kerning!

    It is okay for your resumé to be a statement about who you are, that's why we
    read it.

5. **Read. It. Aloud.**

    Did you just say "yeah sure" before and then not do it?  I _mean it. Do it._


### Here is your Handful of Salt

So first off - this is not a "How to Get A Job" post - this covers *just* the
resumé and cover letter section.  There are several other steps you need to
pass, all of which have higher signal. Interviews, code challenges, phone
screens, etc. If you're an asshole or you have no relevant skills, no amount of
"kickass resumé" is going to overcome that deficit.

Second - I read the resumés of software developers, so if you're applying for a
job as a Marketing Manager, understand you're outside my area of expertise. Some
hiring processes are designed to remove as much personality as possible from the
process (looking at you, academia.) So, while software hiring may be broken in
many ways, _so far_ we're doing an okayish job at not reducing "Do I want to
spend eight hours a day discussing math and puzzles with this person?" to a list
of impersonal checkboxes.

Now, I'm sure there are companies in the world that get so many resumés that
nobody reads them, and most of them are simply run through a keyword analyzer.
So in that case, follow this advice anyway. The strategy of copying
qualifications directly into your resumé ought to overcome simple keyword
filters, and anything more complex than that is just a [pile of linear algebra
nobody understands anyway.](https://xkcd.com/1838/) Just ignore scare-mongering
about automated systems. Those kinds of systems are designed to generate
plausible deniability, not "find good candidates."

Now, for a uncomfortable truth: There is a **giant** element of chance in
getting past an initial screen. There isn't a whole lot to go on in a resumé, so
a chunk of what gets a reviewer to give you a thumbs up hinges on whether your
resumé speaks to _them_.  _The Lord of the Rings_ is probably my favorite book
of all time, but a lot of people find it terribly dull.  You cannot write
for all audiences, and attempting to do so will result in you writing for _no_
audiences.  Be yourself, tell _your_ story in an engaging way, and you'll land
at a place where people _want_ to spend half their waking hours engaging with
you.

And, when you think about it, would you want to spend that much time at a place
that thought you were just _too interesting?_

<a name="liar">1.</a> "But I'm not lying, that's really true!" - You know, I'm sure
it is, but have you ever said this outside the context of a resumé or cover
letter? If not, you need to find a more engaging way of saying this that not
every person with a pulse is _also_ writing in their applications. If you have
said this in "real life" ... you need to go to better parties.
